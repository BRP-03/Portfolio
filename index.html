            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Bhavesh Rajpurohit, a passionate BCA second-year student currently studying at LJ College of Computer Application (affilated to Gujarat University). I‚Äôm deeply interested in the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and my ultimate goal is to become one of the top AI/ML developers in the industry.
                What started as a curiosity has now turned into a strong passion ‚Äî I code because I enjoy solving complex problems and creating something meaningful out of logic.
            </p>
            <p>Besides coding, I‚Äôm a huge anime fan ‚Äî so if you love anime too, we already have something in common! I also enjoy reading and writing books, especially ones that spark deep thoughts and creativity.
                Music keeps me going ‚Äî from love songs during calm moments to phonk beats while I‚Äôm immersed in code. Oh, and I do love playing games when I‚Äôm not programming or reading.</p>
            <p>If you're into tech, AI, books, anime, or just looking to connect ‚Äî feel free to reach out!</p>
